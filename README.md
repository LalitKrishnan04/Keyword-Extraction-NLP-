# Keyword-Extraction-NLP-
has explored and integrated advanced techniques in natural language processing for
keyword extraction, leveraging BERT models, TF-IDF protocol, and WordNet as a dataset.
Each method contributes uniquely to enhancing the precision and relevance of extracted
keywords. Utilizing BERT has enabled the extraction of keywords based on deep contextual
understanding, capturing nuanced relationships and meanings within text. This approach is
particularly effective in contexts where context and semantics play a crucial role. The TF-IDF
protocol remains instrumental in identifying keywords by quantifying their significance within
documents relative to the entire corpus. Its statistical approach provides a robust foundation for
prioritizing keywords based on their frequency and relevance. Integrating WordNet enriches
keyword extraction by incorporating lexical and semantic relationships among words. This
semantic enrichment enhances the accuracy and breadth of extracted keywords, considering
synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms.
